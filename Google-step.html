                <p>Google is invested in increasing the number of future computer scientists and software developers, particularly those
                  who are historically underrepresented in the field. Many aspiring computer scientists could benefit from a program
                  that bridges the gap between academic study and a professional internship. Google aims to inspire these students to
                  continue in the field with such a program.
                
                  This program is committed to addressing diversity in our company and in the technology industry. Students who are a
                  member of a group that is historically underrepresented in the technology industry are encouraged to apply.
